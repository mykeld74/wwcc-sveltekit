		The Women's Ministry of Westwoods is an arm of the church that provides opportunities for every
		woman to connect relationally, be encouraged in their walk with Jesus, and equipped to impact
		their world for the Kingdom. Whether it's through monthly Connect events, mom gatherings,
		focusing on fitness, regular bible study, praying together, holiday events, play dates, service
		opportunities, tea and coffee chats, impromptu fun, mentor meetings or parenting discussions,
		there is a place for YOU! Our hope is that ladies will be encouraged and challenged by doing
		life and building friendships!

	<p><strong>All Women Welcome!</strong></p>

		creating an on-going meal train crew sign up. If you would like to be someone to potentially
		prepare and drop off a meal for someone in need, please add your info to this google form:
